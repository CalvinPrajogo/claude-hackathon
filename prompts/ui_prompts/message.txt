You are an expert product designer and UI/UX architect.

Design the full web UI for a product called **MadSocial** — a Madison-only social platform focused on:
- Today’s **social events**
- **Pregames** (small meetups / groups going to an event)
- **Hosts** managing pregame join requests
- **Mutual friends** and social discovery inside each event

This is a **web app** first, but should be visually easy to adapt to mobile later. The goal is to produce a cohesive, production-ready UI concept, not just vague ideas.

====================================================
1. BRANDING & VISUAL LANGUAGE
====================================================

Overall vibe:
- Clean, modern, social, energetic.
- Feels like a UW–Madison campus app (but not tacky).
- Focused on **people and events**, not corporate.

Color palette (use these explicitly):
- **Badger Red** as the primary accent.
  - Example: hex approx `#C5050C` (you can tweak slightly but keep it “Badger red”).
- **Badger White** as the primary background for content cards and main areas.
- Neutrals:
  - Light grey backgrounds and dividers (e.g. `#F5F5F5`, `#E5E5E5`).
  - Dark grey / near-black text (e.g. `#111111` / `#222222`).
- Use Badger Red for:
  - Primary buttons (e.g. “Join Pregame”, “Host a Pregame”)
  - Highlights (selected state, active tab, key counters)
- Use subtle shadows and rounded corners on cards:
  - Border radius: 10–16px on cards and buttons.
  - Elevation: soft shadow, no heavy skeuomorphism.

Typography:
- A clean, modern sans serif, e.g. Inter / SF Pro / Roboto style.
- Hierarchy:
  - H1: Date + Page title (e.g. “Wednesday, November 19, 2025”) — bold, 24–32px.
  - H2: Section titles like “Today’s Events”, “Pregames for This Event” — 18–22px, semi-bold.
  - Event titles: 18–20px, semi-bold.
  - Body text: 14–16px, regular.
  - Caption/small labels: 12–13px.

Icon style:
- Simple line icons with minimal fills.
- Rounded edges, consistent stroke weight.
- Icons for calendar, clock, map pin, people, host, requests, etc.

====================================================
2. GLOBAL LAYOUT & NAVIGATION
====================================================

Design this as a **desktop web layout** with a clear structure:

- **Top Nav Bar** (persistent across pages):
  - Left: MadSocial logo/wordmark (Badger Red accent).
  - Center or left: Main navigation items:
    - “Today”
    - “Upcoming” (for future extension; keep subtle)
    - “My Pregames”
    - “Profile”
  - Right:
    - User avatar with dropdown (name, settings, logout).
  - Background: White, subtle bottom shadow.

- **Main Layout Pattern:**
  - Content max width: ~1200–1280px, centered.
  - Use a **two-column layout** where sensible:
    - Left: Main content (events, pregames).
    - Right: Contextual sidebar (mutuals, host tools, selected pregame info).
  - Add consistent padding around content (24–32px).

- **Responsive behavior (high level):**
  - On smaller widths, stack columns (main content first, sidebar beneath).
  - Navigation collapses into a top bar + hamburger menu.

====================================================
3. SCREEN 1 – “TODAY” (FIRST PAGE USERS SEE)
====================================================

Goal: When a user lands, they immediately see **today’s date** and a list of **today’s social events**.

Layout:

- Top of page (under nav bar):
  - H1 row: “Today” and the full date.
    - Example: “Today — Wednesday, November 19, 2025”
    - Date could be accompanied by a small calendar icon.
  - Optional right side: a small dropdown to change date (for future), but default is today.

- Below the title:
  - Section title: “Today’s Events”
  - Add a simple filter bar:
    - Filter chips: [All] [Parties] [Bars/Clubs] [Games] [Concerts] [House Events]
    - Sort dropdown: “Sort by Time / Popularity”
    - A small search input: “Search events…”

Event list:

- Represent each event as a **card** in a single-column feed or a 2-column grid.
  Each event card includes:
  - Event title (e.g. “Badgers vs Iowa — Camp Randall”).
  - Time: Start time (e.g. “7:00 PM”).
  - Location: Simple text, e.g. “Camp Randall Stadium”.
  - Vibe tag chips: “Game”, “High Energy”, “Tailgate”.
  - Small pill showing the number of pregames already created:
    - e.g. “5 Pregames”
  - Small pill showing “Friends Going” if applicable:
    - e.g. “3 friends going” (but **do not show who** yet, only count).
  - Primary action button: “View Event”.
    - This should be Badger Red, right-aligned bottom of card.
  - Secondary actions (text links or dropdown):
    - “Save for later” (optional).

Empty states:
- If no events today, show a friendly empty state illustration/text:
  - “No social events listed for today yet. Check back later or explore upcoming days.”

Interactions:
- Clicking anywhere on the event card or the “View Event” button navigates to the **Event Detail Page** for that event.

====================================================
4. SCREEN 2 – EVENT DETAIL PAGE (EVENT 1)
====================================================

When a user clicks an event (Event 1), they go to the **Event Detail Page**.

Overall layout:
- Top section: event summary.
- Left column: list of pregames for this event.
- Right column: mutual friends & maybe event info recap.
- A prominent button to **Host Your Own Pregame**.

Top event header (full width):
- Event title (H1 style).
- Secondary row with:
  - Date + Time.
  - Location (with map pin icon).
  - Vibe tags.
- A subtle background band or card to make the header feel special.

Section: Pregames List

- On the left column, below the header:
  - Header row:
    - Title: “Pregames for This Event”
    - Right side: a primary button “Host a Pregame” in Badger Red.
  - Under this, a list of pregames (cards) associated with this event.

Design each pregame card with:
- Pregame title:
  - e.g. “Lakeshore Tailgate — Dejope 6:30PM”
- Host info:
  - Host name (small avatar + name).
  - Year & major under the name in smaller text.
